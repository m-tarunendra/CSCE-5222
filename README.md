# Image Feature Extraction and Motion Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on image feature extraction and motion recognition. The primary objective is to accurately identify motions presented by individuals through effective feature extraction techniques. By employing various approaches for feature extraction, we aim to gather a comprehensive set of characteristics for our model. These features are then utilized to train prediction models, ultimately selecting the most suitable model to achieve high accuracy.

## Project Goals
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilize various techniques to extract relevant features from images.
- **Motion Recognition**: Develop a model capable of accurately recognizing motions presented by individuals.
- **Model Training**: Train prediction models using the extracted features to enhance motion recognition accuracy.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate and select the most suitable model to achieve optimal performance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather images and videos containing different motions.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Apply multiple feature extraction techniques to retrieve characteristics from the images.
3. **Model Training**: Use the extracted features to train various prediction models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of each model and select the one with the highest accuracy.
5. **Deployment**: Implement the selected model for real-time motion recognition.
